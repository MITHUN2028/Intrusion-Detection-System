Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning

This project is a Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that classifies network traffic as either normal or malicious.
It uses multiple classification algorithms to detect potential cyber threats and provides an early warning mechanism to improve network security.

Developed using Python and Streamlit, the system offers both model comparison and real-time prediction capabilities.
